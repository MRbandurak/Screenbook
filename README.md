# Screenbook
A little in function simple do thath i cerated for purpose of making a copy of 800+ pages long E-book from Kindle for PC.
It basically takes a scrennshot of coordinated space at start of program and pastes it to wordpad. 
You will get cordinnates by using control viewer - which you will get a binary from https://www.autoitscript.com/forum/files/file/457-control-viewer/ . 
I will apriciate if someone more skilled will take this somewhere further.

PS> Yes and it worked flawlessly for that purpose. That's why i upploaded it.
Tip- use .pdf instead of .doc MS_word will not open bigger file than 512MB and wordpad will have troble with it ... and also if dont want to use adobe acrobat reader MS_Edge is from my point of view better FREE pdf reader ;) .
